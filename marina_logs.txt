request : what does this program do ?

Code :import time

print(time.asctime())

The program you provided in `test.py` imports the `time` module and then prints the current local time as a string formatted in a human-readable way.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `import time`: This line imports the `time` module, which provides various time-related functions.

2. `print(time.asctime())`: This line calls the `asctime()` function from the `time` module. The `asctime()` function returns the current time in a format like "Day Month Date Hour:Minute:Second Year". If no time argument is given, it uses the current local time.

When you run the script, it will output something like:
```
Wed Oct 11 15:35:46 2023
```
(Note: The actual output will depend on the current date and time when the program is executed.)---------------
